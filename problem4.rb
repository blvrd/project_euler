#Problem 4
#A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
#Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

def palindrome?(a)
  a.to_s == a.to_s.reverse
end

def divisible_by_3digit?(a)
  999.downto(100) do |i|
    if a % i == 0 && a / i < 999
      return true
    end
  end
  false
end

largest = 999 * 999

while true do
  if palindrome?(largest)
    if divisible_by_3digit?(largest)
      break
    end
  end
  largest -= 1
end

puts largest

#The answer is 906609
